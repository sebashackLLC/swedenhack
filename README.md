This project is a clean and open-source yet modern alternative aiming to be transparent and easy to extend without relying on unsafe third-party clients.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How do I open the ClickGUI?</summary>

The default keybind is **Right Shift**. You can rebind it in Minecraft's Controls menu (look for the Swedenhack category) or from the ClickGUI module itself.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the command prefix?</summary>

The default command prefix is `.`. For example, `.help` or `.bind`. You can change it with the `.prefix <new>` command.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How are modules organized?</summary>

Modules are grouped by category. Open the ClickGUI to browse and toggle them, or bind individual modules to a key.
